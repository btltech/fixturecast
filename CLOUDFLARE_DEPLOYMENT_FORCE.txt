🚨 CRITICAL CLOUDFLARE DEPLOYMENT FIX 🚨
================================

This file forces Cloudflare Pages to detect new commits and trigger a fresh deployment.

🔧 Issue: Cloudflare was deploying old cached code with duplicate export statements
📝 Solution: New build with cache-busting identifiers and fresh deployment

Target Commit: 65af47f (WORKING VERSION)

⚠️ If deployment still fails:

2. Verify environment variables: VITE_FOOTBALL_API_KEY, FOOTBALL_API_KEY
3. Clear Cloudflare cache manually in dashboard
4. Trigger new deployment (not retry)

✅ VERIFIED FIXES:
- No duplicate export statements
- All syntax errors resolved
- Local build working perfectly
- Debug and health check pages included
- API connectivity with fallback keys working
