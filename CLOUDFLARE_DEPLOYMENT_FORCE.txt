CLOUDFLARE DEPLOYMENT FORCE FILE
================================

This file was created to force Cloudflare Pages to detect the new commit.

Current Status:
- Local build: ✅ WORKING
- Latest commit: 2f73263
- Build ID: 2025-09-20-v5-FINAL-FIX-WORKING
- All syntax errors: ✅ FIXED

Expected Result:
Cloudflare should now deploy commit 2f73263 instead of the broken 0d6adb4.

If Cloudflare is still deploying 0d6adb4, there may be a configuration issue:
1. Check if Cloudflare is connected to the correct repository
2. Check if Cloudflare is configured to deploy from the 'main' branch
3. Check if there are any deployment restrictions or caching issues

This commit contains all the fixes and should resolve the "Oops! Something went wrong" error.
