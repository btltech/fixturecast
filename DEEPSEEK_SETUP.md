# DeepSeek Integration Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Install DeepSeek SDK (if needed)
```bash
# DeepSeek uses standard OpenAI-compatible API, no additional packages needed
```

### 2. Add DeepSeek API Key to Environment
Add this to your `.env` or `.env.local` file:
```bash
VITE_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here
```

### 3. Test the Integration
1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the test page:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/test-models
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions:
   - Click "Load Today's Matches"
   - Select a match
   - Click "Test" to compare both models

## 🧪 What the Test Does

The test will:
1. ✅ Load real football matches from today
2. ✅ Build context data for both models
3. ✅ Run Gemini 2.5 Flash prediction
4. ✅ Run DeepSeek V3.1 Terminus prediction  
5. ✅ Compare results side-by-side
6. ✅ Show performance metrics (response time, confidence)

## 📊 Expected Results

**DeepSeek Advantages:**
- 🎯 Better reasoning and analysis
- 📈 More sophisticated probability calculations
- 🧠 Superior football domain knowledge
- ⚡ Potentially faster response times
- 💰 Better cost efficiency

**What to Look For:**
- More detailed and logical key factors
- Better probability calibration (realistic percentages)
- More nuanced confidence assessments
- Consistent JSON formatting
- Better market predictions (BTTS, O/U, etc.)

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

If DeepSeek performs better:

### Option 1: Full Switch
Replace Gemini entirely with DeepSeek in production

### Option 2: Gradual Migration
- Use DeepSeek for new predictions
- Keep Gemini as fallback
- A/B test with users

### Option 3: Ensemble Approach
- Use both models
- Combine predictions for higher accuracy
- Use DeepSeek for complex analysis, Gemini for speed
